# VerletSVG
### Apply Verlet integration on SVG objects for Liquid like animations / functional logos

This is a sample project for my upcoming YouTube series on using D3's force layouts + Turf.js for 2D animations, and  is more of a playground. Polished demos and libraries will be posted under The Brainery organization.
